        <p>To start painting, you need the right materials:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Canvas or painting paper</li>
            <li>Paints (Acrylic, Watercolor, or Oil)</li>
            <li>Paintbrushes of different sizes</li>
            <li>Palette for mixing colors</li>
            <li>Cup of water or solvent for cleaning brushes</li>
            <li>Rags or paper towels for cleanup</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. Choose Your Subject</h2>
        <p>Decide what you want to paint. It could be a landscape, portrait, abstract design, or still life. If you're unsure, look for inspiration in nature, photographs, or famous paintings.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Sketch the Outline</h2>
        <p>Use a pencil to lightly sketch the composition on your canvas. This will help guide your painting process and maintain proportions.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Mix Your Colors</h2>
        <p>Using your palette, mix different shades to get the desired colors. Experiment with blending to create depth and realism in your artwork.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Start Painting</h2>
        <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/w3images/nature.jpg" alt="Painting in Progress">
        <p>Begin with the background and work your way forward. Use broad strokes for large areas and finer brushes for details.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Add Details and Layers</h2>
        <p>Once the base layer dries, add more details, shadows, and highlights to give your painting depth and dimension.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Final Touches</h2>
        <p>Review your painting and make any necessary adjustments. Add final highlights, fix any mistakes, and sign your work!</p>
        
        <h2>8. Let It Dry</h2>
        <p>Allow your painting to dry completely before framing or displaying it.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Painting is a fulfilling and enjoyable activity. Keep practicing, experiment with different styles, and most importantly, have fun!</p>
